Purpose
=======

The purpose of this repo has always been to provide myself a good starting point for new frontend development projects. 

Current State
=============

The most recent master is a hacky combination of Ember.js and Skeleton CSS on top of a stripped down, patched up HTML5 Boilerplate.

History
=======

This repo has been a storage location for a bunch of different, entirely messy, JS code examples that I have schizophrenically added over the past year or so.

This project started out as a really simple js game engine. It has evolved(devolved?) into a wireframing tool with the following features:

Check the various branches to see the examples. I've tried to add a bit of information to the README files of each branch but, really, it's probably a bunch of noise, hough there may be some useful pieces of information here and there.

1. It uses HTML5 Boilerplate as a starting point.
2. It includes the best features of Skeleton CSS to help with simple layout/bootstrap-esque mockup-ing while holding onto responsive design.
3. It includes Ember.js as a tool to really make the front end development useful. Handlebars templates FTW.

In the past (in other branches) it has included Raphael.js, Backbone.js/Underscore, Agility.js, and some custom debugging libraries I wrote.

Now, I'm sick of writing JS libraries and I just want to get things out INTO the world.

So, this has become a quick test of using Ember.js and Skeleton on top of a nice clean HTML5 Boilerplate to help spit out real, useable wireframes.

In the long run, this code will be ploped into either a Rails or Node.js/Express server side implamentation. Maybe Rendr (from Airbnb) will be stable enough by that point.

Good luck!
James
