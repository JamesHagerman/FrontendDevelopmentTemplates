This project was a simple test of Raphael.js limitations and how it could be used to draw some simple expanding dots.

Click on a dot and more dots will be made. Debug window shows some stats.

Too bad Raphael sucks at moving the camera around on an existing scene. Not to mention it's issues with using SVG...
