This branch is the start of the actual wireframe code that is most current in Master at the time of this writing.

It's useless for now because it's just MASTER and you're probably better off using that branch since this branch doesn't work.

If I ever want to change the direction of this branch again, I will probably merge any newer changes to this branch at that point.
