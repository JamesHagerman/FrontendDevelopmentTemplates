Purpose
=======

The purpose of this project is to provide a solid frontend development template. 


Live Example
============

The current HEAD checkout can be seen over at http://files.zenpirate.com/FrontendDevelopmentTemplates/

Current Version
=============

It combines Ember.js and Skeleton CSS and places both of those tools on top of a stripped down and minified HTML5 Boilerplate. It has the following features:

1. It is loosely based on the HTML5 Boilerplate project
2. It provides Skeleton as an ultra lightweight replacement for Twitter Bootstrap
3. It provides Ember.js as a "better" replacement for Backbone.js

Code written using this project should have very little issues integrating into a Rails or Node.js/Express environment. 

History of this Repository
=======

For a while this repository was a dumping ground for half hearted attempts at various development templates for client-side, javascript and canvas games.

Over time, I realized that I still didn't have a truly useable front end development template because most of the projects I wanted to do were not in the realm of making games in Javascript. Furthermore, in all of those templates I had focused too much on the javascript tools involved, and not enough on the "getting things done" part. 

In the last year or so I have schizophrenically added a bunch of different, entirely messy, JS code examples covering a pretty good cross section of ideas and tools. These "templates" included bits and pieces of Raphael.js, Backbone.js/Underscore, Agility.js (customized to support serverside templates), and some customized debugging and helper libraries.

Check the various branches to see the examples. They all should launch from index.html. I've tried to add a bit of information to the README files of each branch but, really, it probably just looks like a bunch of noise.
